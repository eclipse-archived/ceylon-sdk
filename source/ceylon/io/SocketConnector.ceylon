"Represents an object that you can use to connect to a remote host.
 
 Both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation are supported:
 
 - use [[connect]] to block until the socket is connected, or
 - use [[connectAsync]] to register a listener that will be invoked when
   the socket is connected.
 
 You create new socket connectors with [[newSocketConnector]].
