import ceylon.io.impl { SelectorImpl }

"Represents a listener that can listen for read/write/connect/accept events
 directly from the operating system. 
 
 You can register listeners for :
 
 - read/write events on [[SelectableFileDescriptor]],
 - accept events on [[ServerSocket]],
 - connect events on [[SocketConnector]].
 
 Those listeners will then be called by this selector when you invoke [[process]] until
 there are no more listeners.
 
 Every listener can signal the selector object that it is no longer interested in
 notifications by returning `false` when invoked, except for `connect` listeners which
 are only notified once (since you can only connect a [[Socket]] once). 
 
 Listeners should be registered with:
 
 - [[addConsumer]] for `read` events,
 - [[addProducer]] for `write` events,
 - [[addConnectListener]] for `connect` events, and
 - [[addAcceptListener]] for `accept` events.
 
 You can instantiate new selectors with [[newSelector]].
