 The __&lt;blockquote&gt;__ element indicates that the enclosed text is an 
 extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation.
 
 Example:
 
 <table style='width:100%'>
     <tr style='vertical-align: top'>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='ceylon'>
 Blockquote { cite=\"http://developer.mozilla.org\";
     P { \"This is a quotation taken from the Mozilla Developer Center.\" }
 };
 </pre>
 
         </td>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='html'>
 &lt;blockquote cite=\"http://developer.mozilla.org\"&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;This is a quotation taken from the Mozilla Developer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 </pre>
         </td>         
     </tr>
 </table>
