"""A class for cross-platform regular expressions modeled on Javascript's
   `RegExp`, plus some extra methods like Java's and Javascript `String`'s
   `replace` and `split` methods (taking a `RegExp` parameter) that are missing
   from Ceylon's version of [[String]]. To create an instance of this class
   use the toplevel function [[regex]].
   
   Example usage:
   
       Regex re = regex("[0-9]+ years");
       assert(re.test("90 years old"));
       print(re.replace("90 years old", "very"));
       
   There are a few small incompatibilities between the two implementations.
   Java-specific constructs in the regular expression syntax (e.g. [a-z&&[^bc]],
   (?<=foo), \A, \Q) work only on the JVM backend, while the Javascript-specific
   constructs $` and $' in the replacement expression work only on the Javascript
   backend, not the JVM backend, which rejects them. There are also sure to
   exist small differences between the different browser implementations,
   be sure to test thoroughly, especially when using more advanced features.
