"Implementation of [[Range]] and allows easy iteration between [[Date]] types.
 
 Provides all power of [[Iterable]] features and complements with:
 * Easy way to recover [[Period]]
 * Easy way to recober [[Duration]]
 * Recover the overlap between [[DateRange]] types
 * Recover the gap between [[DateRange]] types
 * Allows cutomized way to iterate as navigate between values by [[UnitOfDate]] cases
