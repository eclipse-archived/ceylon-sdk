"A clock providing access to the current instant, date and time using a time-zone.
 
 Instances of this class are used to find the current instant, which can be
 interpreted using the stored time-zone to find the current date and time.
 As such, a clock can be used instead of `process.milliseconds`.
 
 The primary purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate clocks to be
 plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain the
 current time rather than a static method. This can simplify testing.
 
 Applications should _avoid_ using the top level objects directly.
 Instead, they should pass a [[Clock]] into any method that requires it.
 A dependency injection framework is one way to achieve this.
 
 This approach allows an alternate clock, such as [[fixedTime]] to be used during testing.
 
 The [[systemTime]] top level factory method offers clocks based on the best available 
 system clock, such as `process.milliseconds`."
