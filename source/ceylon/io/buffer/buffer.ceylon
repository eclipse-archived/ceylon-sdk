doc "Represents a memory buffer that can be read and written to with no
     allocation. The easiest way to get an idea of what a buffer is, is that
     it constists in an array of a given [[capacity]], a [[position]] index within the 
     array, and a [[limit]] index.
     
     Typical operations on a buffer will be to fill it, which you do with [[put]]
     until you reach the [[limit]].
     
     Then if you want to read the data you just put in the buffer, you [[flip]] the
     buffer, which will and set its [[limit]] to the current [[position]],
     and reset its [[position]] to `0`. This essentially means that you will be able
     to read from the beginning of the buffer until the last object you [[put]] in
     it when writing.
     
     You can then start calling [[get]] to read objects from this buffer until you
     reach its [[limit]].
     
     Once you are done reading from the buffer, you will [[clear]] the buffer to start
     writing to it again. That will reset the [[position]] to `0` and the [[limit]]
     to the [[capacity]], allowing you to write to the full underlying array.
     
     Buffers can be resized (grown and expanded), which will cause an underlying
     array reallocation and copy.
