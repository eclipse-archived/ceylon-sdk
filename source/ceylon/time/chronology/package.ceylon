doc "Package containing supported chronologies in ceylon.time library.
     
     A _Chronology_ is a set of functions and methods that define the calendar system. A Chronology is tightly coupled to the actual date implementation of that chronology.
     
     Generally speaking, a chronology is an implementation detail of a calendar system that should not be overly visible to the users of the library unless they wish to implement their own calendrical systems.
     
     Initial implementation contains only implementation for gregorian (and julian) chronologies. This API is considered experimental and can change significantly between releases, so dependency on this package is not advisable for general use."
