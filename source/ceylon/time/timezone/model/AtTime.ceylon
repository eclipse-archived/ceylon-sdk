"First, the time that something happens (in the AT column) is not necessarily the local wall clock time. 
 
 The time can be suffixed with ‘s’ (for “standard”) to mean local standard time (different from wall clock time when observing daylight saving time); 
 or it can be suffixed with ‘g’, ‘u’, or ‘z’, all three of which mean the standard time at the prime meridan. 
 ‘g’ stands for “GMT”; 
 ‘u’ stands for “UT” or “UTC” (whichever was official at the time); 
 ‘z’ stands for the nautical time zone Z (a.k.a. “Zulu” which, in turn, stands for ‘Z’). 
 The time can also be suffixed with ‘w’ meaning “wall clock time;” 
 but it usually isn’t because that’s the default.
